COURSE 4

==> Well-aligned objectives and data
- Clean data + alignment to business objective = accurate conclusions
- Alignment to business objective + additional data cleaning = accurate conclusions 
- Alignment to business objective + newly discovered variables + constraints = accurate conclusions 

==>Terminology
--> Definitions

- Population :
The entire group that you are interested in for your study. For example, if you are surveying people in your company, the population would be all the employees in your company.

- Sample 
A subset of your population. Just like a food sample, it is called a sample because it is only a taste. So if your company is too large to survey every individual, you can survey a representative sample of your population.

- Margin of error
Since a sample is used to represent a population, the sample’s results are expected to differ from what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. This difference is called the margin of error. The smaller the margin of error, the closer the results of the sample are to what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. 

- Confidence level
The confidence level is the probability that your sample accurately reflects the greater population
How confident you are in the survey results. For example, a 95% confidence level means that if you were to run the same survey 100 times, you would get similar results 95 of those 100 times. Confidence level is targeted before you start your study because it will affect how big your margin of error is at the end of your study. 

- Confidence interval
The range of possible values that the population’s result would be at the confidence level of the study. This range is the sample result +/- the margin of error.

- Statistical significance
The determination of whether your result could be due to random chance or not. The greater the significance, the less due to chance.
Usually, you need a statistical power of at least 0.8 or 80% to consider your results statistically significant.

-Statistical power
 can be calculated and reported for a completed experiment to comment on the confidence one might have in the conclusions drawn from the results of the study. It can also be used as a tool to estimate the number of observations or sample size required in order to detect an effect in an experiment.

- Estimated response rate
If you are running a survey of individuals, this is the percentage of people you expect will complete your survey out of those who received the survey.

==> Dirty Data-
-->Types of Dirty Data
- Duplicate data
Description - Any data record that shows up more than once
Possible causes- Manual data entry, batch data imports, or data migration
Potential harm to businesses- Skewed metrics or analyses, inflated or inaccurate counts or predictions, or confusion during data retrieval

- Outdated data
Description - Any data that is old which should be replaced with newer and more accurate information
Possible causes - People changing roles or companies, or software and systems becoming obsolete
Potential harm to businesses - Inaccurate insights, decision-making, and analytics

-Incomplete data
Description - Any data that is missing important fields
Possible causes - Improper data collection or incorrect data entry
Potential harm to businesses - Decreased productivity, inaccurate insights, or inability to complete essential services

- Incorrect/inaccurate data
Description - Any data that is complete but inaccurate
Possible causes - Human error inserted during data input, fake information, or mock data
Potential harm to businesses - Inaccurate insights or decision-making based on bad information resulting in revenue loss

- Inconsistent data
Description - Any data that uses different formats to represent the same thing
Possible causes - Data stored incorrectly or errors inserted during data transfer
Potential harm to businesses - Contradictory data points leading to confusion or inability to classify or segment customers

TRANSPOSING - 
 This Help you convert the data from the current long format (more rows than columns) to the wide format (more columns than rows). This action is called transposing. To transpose your data:

1. Highlight and copy the data that you want to transpose including the column labels. You can do this by highlighting Columns A-H. In Excel, highlight only the relevant cells (A1-H45) instead of the headers.

2. Right-click on cell I1. This is where you want the transposed data to start.

3. Hover over Paste Special from the right-click menu. Select the Transposed option. In Excel, select the Transpose icon under the paste options.

You should now find the data transformed into the new wide format. At this point, you should remove the original long data from the spreadsheet.

4. Delete the previous long data. The easiest way to do this is to click on Column A, so the entire column is highlighted. Then, hold down the Shift key and click on Column H. You should find these columns highlighted. Right-click on the highlighted area and select Delete Columns A - H. 

==> Step-by-Step: Optimize the data-cleaning process
Example 1: The COUNTIF function
COUNTIF is a spreadsheet function that returns the number of cells within a range that match a specified value.
In cell I74, enter the formula =COUNTIF(I2:I72,"<100") to count how many members in the cell range I2:I72 pay dues of less than $100. This formula returns a value of 1, indicating one value is below $100.


Example 2: The LEN function
The LEN function is useful if you have a certain piece of information in your spreadsheet that you know must contain a certain length.

Example 3: Use conditional formatting
Conditional formatting is a spreadsheet tool that changes how cells appear when values meet specific conditions.

Example 4: The LEFT and RIGHT functions
LEFT is a function that returns a set number of characters from the left side of a text string. RIGHT is a function that returns a set number of characters from the right side of a text string. 

Example 5: The MID function
MID is a function that returns a segment from the middle of a text string.

Example 6: The CONCATENATE function
CONCATENATE is a spreadsheet function that joins together two or more text strings.

Example 7: TRIM function
TRIM is a function that removes leading, trailing, and repeated spaces in data.


==> Workflow automation
Basically, workflow automation is the process of automating parts of your work. That could mean creating an event trigger that sends a notification when a system is updated
- Modeling the data
Data modeling is a difficult process that involves lots of different factors; luckily there are tools that can completely automate the different stage

==> Different data perspectives
-->Example 1: Pivot tables
A pivot table is a data summarization tool. It can be used in data processing and in data cleaning, for which pivot tables offer a quick, clutter-free view of your data. Pivot tables help sort, reorganize, group, count, total, or average data in a dataset. 
 --> Example 2: VLOOKUP
VLOOKUP is a spreadsheet function that vertically searches for a certain value in a column to return a corresponding piece of information. It's rare for all of the data an analyst will need to be in the same place. Usually, you'll have to search across multiple sheets or even different databases. VLOOKUP helps bring the information together.
--> Example 3: Plotting
The plotting tool allows analysts to quickly create a graph, chart, table, or other visual from data. Plotting is useful for identifying skewed data or outliers

==> Data-cleaning verification checklist
Correct the most common problems
Make sure you identified the most common problems and corrected them, including:

Sources of errors: Did you use the right tools and functions to find the source of the errors in your dataset?

Null data: Did you search for NULLs using conditional formatting and filters?

Misspelled words: Did you locate all misspellings?

Mistyped numbers: Did you double-check that your numeric data has been entered correctly?

Extra spaces and characters: Did you remove any extra spaces or characters using the TRIM function?

Duplicates: Did you remove duplicates in spreadsheets using the Remove Duplicates function or DISTINCT in SQL?

Mismatched data types: Did you check that numeric, date, and string data are typecast correctly?

Messy (inconsistent) strings: Did you make sure that all of your strings are consistent and meaningful?

Messy (inconsistent) date formats: Did you format the dates consistently throughout your dataset?

Misleading variable labels (columns): Did you name your columns meaningfully?

Truncated data: Did you check for truncated or missing data that needs correction?

Business Logic: Did you check that the data makes sense given your knowledge of the business? 

- CHANGELOGS- Automated version control, changelogs, and version control systems are all common tools used to track changes. Changelogs are particularly useful, as they can be used to record the reasons for changes made to data. This can help to ensure data integrity and consistency. Version control systems are most commonly used when making changes to shared queries. They enable analysts to track any changes made and revert to previous versions if necessary.

- A changelog is a document used to record the notable changes made to a project over its lifetime across all of its tasks. It is typically curated so that the changes it records are listed chronologically across all versions of the project.

==> A changelog for a personal project may take any form desired. However, in a professional setting and while collaborating with others, readability is important. These guiding principles help to make a changelog accessible to others: 

- Changelogs are for humans, not machines, so write legibly.

- Every version should have its own entry.

- Each change should have its own line.

- Group the same types of changes. For example, Fixed should be grouped separately from Added.

- Versions should be ordered chronologically starting with the latest.

- The release date of each version should be noted.

==> All the changes for each category should be grouped together. Types of changes usually fall into one of the following categories:

Added: new features introduced

Changed: changes in existing functionality

Deprecated: features about to be removed

Removed: features that have been removed

Fixed: bug fixes

Security: lowering vulnerabilities
