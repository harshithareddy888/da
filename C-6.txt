==> Frameworks for organizing your thoughts about visualization
Frameworks help organize your thoughts about data visualization and give you a useful checklist to reference as you plan and evaluate your data visualization. Here are two frameworks that employ slightly different techniques. Both are intended to improve the quality of your visuals. 

--> The McCandless method
You learned about the David McCandless method earlier in the course; as a refresher, the McCandless method lists four elements of good data visualization: 

- Information: the data with which you’re working 

- Story: a clear and compelling narrative or concept

- Goal: a specific objective or function for the visual

- Visual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

The McCandless method provides terminology that isolates the specific elements of a graphic, allowing the person making a visual the ability to evaluate how well those criteria have been met. The aim when crafting a visualization is to incorporate all four elements effectively. Visualizations that fail to incorporate all four elements can be ineffective at communicating insights in various ways. For example, visual form without a goal, story, or data could be a sketch or even art. Data in visual form without a goal or function is just a pretty picture. Data with a goal but no story or visual form can be boring. All four elements need to be present to create an effective visual.

--> Kaiser Fung’s Junk Charts trifecta checkup

This approach is a set of questions that can help consumers of data visualization critique what they are consuming and determine how effective it is. You can also use these questions to determine if your data visualization is effective:

- What is the practical question? 

- What does the data say?

- What does the visual say? 

Each of these questions offers an opportunity to investigate a given problem with a slightly different context. A well-designed visual effectively answers all three of those questions at once. Moreover, this framework helps you think about your data viz from the perspective of your audience. 


==> Pre-attentive attributes
In addition to the frameworks mentioned above, several standard building blocks can help you construct your data visualizations. Creating effective visuals means leveraging what is known about how the brain works, and then using specific visual elements to communicate the information effectively. Pre-attentive attributes are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically and without conscious effort. The essential, basic building blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels. 


==>Graphical Representations
-> Line chart 
A line chart is used to track changes over short and long periods of time. When smaller changes exist, line charts are better to use than bar graphs. Line charts can also be used to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group. 

-> Column chart 
Column charts use size to contrast and compare two or more values, using height or lengths to represent the specific values.  

-> Heatmap 
Similar to bar charts, heatmaps also use color to compare categories in a data set. They are mainly used to show relationships between two variables and use a system of color-coding to represent different values.

-> Pie chart
The pie chart is a circular graph that is divided into segments representing proportions corresponding to the quantity it represents, especially when dealing with parts of a whole.

-> Scatterplot
Scatterplots show relationships between different variables. Scatterplots are typically used for two variables for a set of data, although additional variables can be displayed.

-> Distribution graph
A distribution graph displays the spread of various outcomes in a dataset.

-> Histogram
If outcomes are categorized on the x-axis by distinct numeric values (or ranges of numeric values), the distribution becomes a histogram.
If data is collected from a customer rewards program, they could categorize how many customers consume between one and ten cups of coffee per week. The histogram would have ten columns representing the number of cups, and the height of the columns would indicate the number of customers drinking that many cups of coffee per week.

Reviewing each of these visual examples, where do you notice that they fit in relation to your type of data? One way to answer this is by evaluating patterns in data. Meaningful patterns can take many forms, such as:
- Change: This is a trend or instance of observations that become different over time. A great way to measure change in data is through a line or column chart.

- Clustering: A collection of data points with similar or different values. This is best represented through a distribution graph.

- Relativity: These are observations considered in relation or in proportion to something else. You have probably seen examples of relativity data in a pie chart.

- Ranking: This is a position in a scale of achievement or status. Data that requires ranking is best represented by a column chart.

- Correlation: This shows a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things. A scatterplot is an excellent way to represent this type of data pattern.

==>Decision tree uses

A decision tree is a flowchart that you can use to help frame larger decisions as a series of smaller yes/no decisions. These are useful when trying to choose the best data visualization to communicate a given message to your audience. Because different visualizations have different strengths and weaknesses, a decision tree can help you pick the best visualization for your data and audience. 

Decision tree concepts and best practices
Before you use the decision tree in a scenario to create successful data visualizations, take a moment to review some of the design concepts and best practices you’ve learned so far. Recall that there are four elements of successful data visualization: 

- Information: reflects the conclusion you’ve drawn from the data, which you will communicate with visualization

- Story: adds meaning to the data and makes it interesting

- Goals: makes the data usable and useful

- Visual form: creates both beauty and structure

===> Principle of Design
1. Balance: The design of a data visualization is balanced when the key visual elements, like color and shape, are distributed evenly. This doesn’t mean that you need complete symmetry, but your visualization shouldn’t have one side distracting from the other. If your data visualization is balanced, this could mean that the lines used to create the graphics are similar in length on both sides, or that the space between objects is equal. 

2. Emphasis: Your data visualization should have a focal point, so that your audience knows where to concentrate. In other words, your visualizations should emphasize the most important data so that users recognize it first. Using color and value is one effective way to make this happen. By using contrasting colors, you can make certain that graphic elements—and the data shown in those elements—stand out

3. Movement: Movement can refer to the path the viewer’s eye travels as they look at a data visualization, or literal movement created by animations. Movement in data visualization should mimic the way people usually read. You can use lines and colors to pull the viewer’s attention across the page. 

4. Pattern: You can use similar shapes and colors to create patterns in your data visualization. This can be useful in a lot of different ways. For example, you can use patterns to highlight similarities between different data sets, or break up a pattern with a unique shape, color, or line to create more emphasis.

5. Repetition: Repeating chart types, shapes, or colors adds to the effectiveness of your visualization. Think about the book sales chart from the previous example: the repetition of the colors helps the audience understand that there are distinct sets of data.

6. Proportion: Proportion is another way that you can demonstrate the importance of certain data. Using various colors and sizes helps demonstrate that you are calling attention to a specific visual over others. If you make one chart in a dashboard larger than the others, then you are calling attention to it. It is important to make sure that each chart accurately reflects and visualizes the relationship among the values in it.

7. Rhythm: This refers to creating a sense of movement or flow in your visualization. Rhythm is closely tied to the movement principle. If your finished design doesn’t successfully create a flow, you might want to rearrange some of the elements to improve the rhythm

8. Variety: Your visualizations should have some variety in the chart types, lines, shapes, colors, and values you use. Variety keeps the audience engaged. But it is good to find balance since too much variety can confuse people. The variety you include should make your dashboards and other visualizations feel interesting and unified.

9. Unity: The last principle is unity. This means that your final data visualization should be cohesive. If the visual is disjointed or not well organized, it will be confusing and overwhelming. 


==>Four elements of successful visualizations
The Venn diagram by David McCandless identifies four elements of successful visualizations: 

- Information (data): The information or data that you are trying to convey is a key building block for your data visualization. Without information or data, you cannot communicate your findings successfully.

- Story (concept): Story allows you to share your data in meaningful and interesting ways. Without a story, your visualization is informative, but not really inspiring. 

- Goal (function): The goal of your data visualization makes the data useful and usable. This is what you are trying to achieve with your visualization. Without a goal, your visualization might still be informative, but can’t generate actionable insights.

- Visual form (metaphor): The visual form element is what gives your data visualization structure and makes it beautiful. Without visual form, your data is not visualized yet. 
All four of these elements are important on their own, but a successful data visualization balances all four.

==> Tableau
- The Data pane in the side bar displays column names in a list. In Tableau and most business intelligence software, you will find two types of data elements: dimensions and measures. 
--> Dimensions contain qualitative values (such as names, dates, or geographical data). You can use dimensions to categorize, segment, and reveal the details in your data. Dimensions affect the level of detail in the view.
--> Measures contain numeric, quantitative values that you can measure. Measures can be aggregated. When you drag a measure into the view, Tableau applies an aggregation to that measure (by default).

Tableau has a wide selection of options for depicting the measure of a given dimension. Most of these options are contained in the Marks card, Filter shelf, and Page shelf.

--> A histogram is ideal for comparing the distribution of two variables by individual grouping.

MODULE 3

==> Live versus static insights
Identifying whether data is live or static depends on certain factors:

- How old is the data?
- How long until the insights are stale or no longer valid to make decisions?
- Does this data or analysis need updating on a regular basis to remain valuable?

==> Static data involves providing screenshots or snapshots in presentations or building dashboards using snapshots of data. There are pros and cons to static data.
PROS
- Can tightly control a point-in-time narrative of the data and insight
- Allows for complex analysis to be explained in-depth to a larger audience

CONS
- Insight immediately begins to lose value and continues to do so the longer the data remains in a static state
-  Snapshots can't keep up with the pace of data change

==> Live data means that you can build dashboards, reports, and views connected to automatically updated data. 
PROS
- Dashboards can be built to be more dynamic and scalable
- Gives the most up-to-date data to the people who need it at the time when they need it
- Allows for up-to-date curated views into data with the ability to build a scalable “single source of truth” for various use cases
- Allows for immediate action to be taken on data that changes frequently
- Alleviates time/resources spent on processes for every analysis

CONS
- Can take engineering resources to keep pipelines live and scalable, which may be outside the scope of some companies' data resource allocation
- Without the ability to interpret data, you can lose control of the narrative, which can cause data chaos (i.e. teams coming to conflicting conclusions based on the same data)
- Can potentially cause a lack of trust if the data isn’t handled properly

==> DASHBOARDS
Dashboards are important in data analysis because they enable people to visualize data in dynamic and interactive ways, which can help enhance what you can do with your data presentations. Data visualizations are most useful when they are presented in a dashboard style format to stakeholders because dashboards put all the key information in the same place, making it easier to understand what's really important. Many dashboards also constantly update to reflect new data and can be interactive. No matter what style of dashboard you choose, they can help you present your data to stakeholders in an impactful way. 


==> Glossary terms from module 3
Terms and definitions for Course 6, Module 3

- Data storytelling: Communicating the meaning of a dataset with visuals and a narrative that are customized for an audience
- Engagement: Capturing and holding someone’s interest and attention during a data presentation

==>Messy data presentation
In the first video, watch and listen carefully for the specific reasons the “messy” presentation falls short. Here is a preview:
No story or logical flow
No titles
Too much text
Inconsistent format (no theme)
No recommendation or conclusion at the end

Messy presentation: people don’t know where to focus their attention 
The main problem with the messy presentation is the lack of a logical flow. Notice also how the data visualizations are hard to understand and appear without any introduction or explanation. The audience has no sense of what they are looking at and why.  When people in the audience have to figure out what the data means without any help, they can end up being lost, confused, and unclear about any actions they need to take. 

==> Good data presentation
In the second video, numerous best practices are applied to create a better presentation on the same topic. This “good” presentation is so much easier to understand than the messy one! Here is a preview:

Title and date the presentation was last updated
Flow or table of contents
Transition slides 
Visual introduction to the data (also used as a repeated theme)
Animated bullet points
Annotations on top of visuals
Logic and progression 
Limitations to the data (caveats) - what the data can’t tell you

Good presentation: people are logically guided through the data
The good presentation logically guides the audience through the data – from the objectives at the beginning all the way to the conclusions at the end. Notice how the data visualizations are introduced using a common theme and are thoughtfully placed before each conclusion. A good presentation gives people in the audience the facts and data, helps them understand what the data means, and provides takeaways about how they can use their understanding to make a change or do some good.
