#### **COURSE-7-RPROGRAMMING**



-- **Module 2**

==> **Vectors and lists in R**

&nbsp; A data structure is a format for organizing and storing data. The most common data structures in the R programming language include vectors, data frames, matrices, and arrays.

&nbsp;- Think of a data structure as a house that contains your data. The separate parts of a house, such as bricks or boards, don’t provide shelter on their own. But talented builders can use their skills and expertise, along with a blueprint, to build a functional house. Data structures are similar: Single data elements don’t give you much information, but when data elements are combined into vectors, data frames, and other data structures, a talented data analyst can use them to solve a business challenge. 



There are two types of vectors in R: atomic vectors and lists. 



==> **Atomic vectors** 

First, you’ll explore the different types of atomic vectors. Then, you’ll learn how to use R code to create, identify, and name the vectors. You’ll also learn how to extract a subset of a vector.



In R, a vector is a group of data elements of the same type, stored in a one-dimensional sequence. Vectors can only contain data of one type. 



There are six primary types of atomic vectors: logical, integer, double, character (which contain strings), complex, and raw. The last two–complex and raw–aren’t as common in data analysis, so you’ll focus on the first four in this course. Together, integers and double vectors are known as numeric vectors because they both contain numbers. 





==> **Create vectors**  

One way to create a vector in R is with the c() function. This function combines multiple values into a vector. To use it, enter the letter c followed by the values you want in your vector inside the parentheses, separated by a comma: c(x, y, z).





==>**Date and Time**

--> **Load tidyverse and lubridate packages**

>install.packages("tidyverse").

>library(tidyverse)

>library(lubridate)



--> **Work with dates and times** 

-- Types

In R, there are three types of data that refer to an instant in time:



\- A date ("2016-08-16")

\- A time within a day ("20:11:59 UTC")

\- And a date-time. This is a date plus a time ("2018-03-31 18:15:48 UTC")



--> When you use  R for analysis, you may need to create date-time formats using the following methods: 

\- From a string

\- From an existing date/time object



For each of these methods, R creates dates in the standard yyyy-mm-dd format by default.



==>**Data Frame**

Data frames are the most common way of storing and analyzing data in R, so it’s important to understand what they are and how to create them. A data frame is a collection of columns containing data, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. Each column has a name that represents a variable and includes one observation per row. Data frames summarize data and organize it into a format that is easy to read and use. 

--> There are a few key things to keep in mind when working with data frames: 



\- Data frames can include many different types of data, including numeric, logical, or character.

\- Data frames can have only one element in each cell.

\- Each column should be named. 

\- Each column should consist of elements of the same data type.



**LOADING TIDYVERSE AND browseVignettes function.**

--> A vignette is documentation that acts as a guide to an R package. A vignette shares details about the problem that the package is designed to solve and how the included functions can help you solve it. The browseVignettes function allows you to read through vignettes of a loaded package.



there's four packages that are an essential part of the workflow for data analysts: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr and readr. You'll most likely use these more often than the others. Ggplot2 is used for data visualization, specifically plots. With ggplot2, you can create a variety of data viz by applying different visual properties to the data variables. Here's an example of ggplot2 in action. You'll have your own chance to use ggplot2 later. Tidyr is a package used for data cleaning to make tidy data. We covered tidy or clean data earlier, but as a quick reminder, it's data where every part of a data table or data frame is the right type in the right place. Tidyr works with wide and long data to make sure this happens. Next, we have readr, which is used for importing data. The most common function from readr is read\_csv. This will import a CSV file into R. A CSV file contains data separated by commas in a table format. To accurately read a dataset with readr, you combine the function with a column specification. The column specification describes how each column should be converted to the most appropriate data type. It's good to keep in mind this isn't usually necessary because readr will figure it out for you automatically. We'll come across readr functions as we continue to explore R. Now on to dplyr. Dplyr offers a consistent set of functions that help you complete some common data manipulation tasks. For example, the select function picks variables based on their names, and the filter function finds cases where certain conditions are true. And, yes, dplyr is another package we'll get to later.



Tibble works with data frames. Purrr works with functions and vectors helping make your code easier to write and more expressive. Stringr includes functions that make it easier to work with strings.

Forcats provides tools that solve common problems with factors. As a quick reminder, factors store categorical data in R where the data values are limited and usually based on a finite group like country or year. Using the tidyverse and its packages will help you fine-tune your analysis.

==> Tibble:

Tibbles offer a streamlined approach to data management, automatically displaying only the first 10 rows of a dataset and only as many columns as can fit on your screen. This makes it easier to handle large datasets while maintaining the integrity of your variable names and data types. Using tibbles in R can make your data exploration more efficient, ensure data integrity, and reduce the risk of errors and data mishandling. The seamless integration of tibbles with the tidyverse ecosystem aligns with industry best practices. Proficiency with tibbles can be a powerful addition to your data analysis toolkit.





###### **LOading the packages and shit**

###### **---**

###### **title: "Lesson 2: Import Solutions**"

If you experience errors, remember that you can search the internet and the RStudio community for help:

https://community.rstudio.com/#



\## Step 1: Load packages

Start by installing your required package. If you have already installed and loaded `tidyverse` in this session, feel free to skip the code chunks in this step.

```{r}

install.packages("tidyverse")

```

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```

\## Step 2: Import data

download the csv file



In the chunk below, you will use the `read\_csv()` function to import data from a .csv in the project folder called "hotel\_bookings.csv" and save it as a data frame called `bookings\_df`:

```{r}

bookings\_df <- read\_csv("hotel\_bookings.csv")

```

Now that you have the `bookings\_df`, you can work with it using all of the  `R` functions you have learned so far. 



\## Step 3: Inspect \& clean data

One common function you can use to preview the data is the `head()` function, which returns the columns and first several rows of data. Check out the `head()` function by running the chunk below:

```{r}

head(bookings\_df)

```



Check out the `str()` function by running the code chunk below:

```{r}

str(bookings\_df)

```



To find out what columns you have in your data frame, try running the the `colnames()` function in the code chunk below:

```{r}

colnames(bookings\_df)

```



If you want to create another data frame using `bookings\_df` that focuses on the average daily rate, which is referred to as `adr` in the data frame, and  `adults`, you can use the following code chunk to do that:

```{r}

new\_df <- select(bookings\_df, `adr`, adults)

```



To create new variables in your data frame, you can use the `mutate()` function. This will make changes to the data frame, but not to the original data set you imported. That source data will remain unchanged. 

```{r}

mutate(new\_df, total = `adr` / adults)

```



\## Step 4: Import your own data

Now you can find your own .csv to import! Using the RStudio Cloud interface, import and save the file in the same folder as this R Markdown document. Then write code in the chunk below to read that data into `R`:

```{r}

own\_df <- read\_csv("<filename.csv>")

```









##### =====> **Lesson 3: Cleaning Solution**



In the chunk below, you will use the `read\_csv()` function to import data from a .csv in the project folder called "hotel\_bookings.csv" and save it as a data frame called `bookings\_df`:



```{r}

bookings\_df <- read\_csv("hotel\_bookings.csv")

```

\## Step 3: Getting to know your data



Before you start cleaning your data, take some time to explore it. You can use several functions that you are already familiar with to preview your data, including the `head()` function in the code chunk below:



```{r}

head(bookings\_df)

```



You can summarize or preview the data with the `str()` and `glimpse()` functions to get a better understanding of the data by running the code chunks below:



```{r}

str(bookings\_df)

```



```{r}

glimpse(bookings\_df)

```



You can also use `colnames()` to check the names of the columns in your data set. Run the code chunk below to find out the column names in this data set:



```{r}

colnames(bookings\_df)

```



Use the `skim\_without\_charts()` function from the `skimr` package by running the code below:



```{r}

skim\_without\_charts(bookings\_df)

```

\## Step 4: Cleaning your data



Based on your notes you are primarily interested in the following variables: hotel, is\_canceled, lead\_time. Create a new data frame with just those columns, calling it `trimmed\_df`.



```{r}

trimmed\_df <- bookings\_df %>% 

&nbsp; select(hotel, is\_canceled, lead\_time)

```



Rename the variable 'hotel' to be named 'hotel\_type' to be crystal clear on what the data is about:



```{r}

trimmed\_df %>% 

&nbsp; select(hotel, is\_canceled, lead\_time) %>% 

&nbsp; rename(hotel\_type = hotel)

```



In this example, you can combine the arrival month and year into one column using the unite() function:



```{r}

example\_df <- bookings\_df %>%

&nbsp; select(arrival\_date\_year, arrival\_date\_month) %>% 

&nbsp; unite(arrival\_month\_year, c("arrival\_date\_month", "arrival\_date\_year"), sep = " ")

```



\## Step 5: Another way of doing things



You can also use the`mutate()` function to make changes to your columns. Let's say you wanted to create a new column that summed up all the adults, children, and babies on a reservation for the total number of people. Modify the code chunk below to create that new column: 



```{r}

example\_df <- bookings\_df %>%

&nbsp; mutate(guests = adults + children + babies)



head(example\_df)

```

Great. Now it's time to calculate some summary statistics! Calculate the total number of canceled bookings and the average lead time for booking - you'll want to start your code after the %>% symbol. Make a column called 'number\_canceled' to represent the total number of canceled bookings. Then, make a column called 'average\_lead\_time' to represent the average lead time. Use the `summarize()` function to do this in the code chunk below:



```{r}

example\_df <- bookings\_df %>%

&nbsp; summarize(number\_canceled = sum(is\_canceled),

&nbsp;           average\_lead\_time = mean(lead\_time))



head(example\_df)

```

===> **Work with bias**
R equips analysts with the ability to address data bias across various domains to ensure equitable representation, enhance trust, and instill credibility in the decision-making process, all while avoiding resource waste. The sample(), SMOTE, and NearMiss algorithms are just a handful of the many functions and methods in R that you can use to address bias in your data. 

MODULE-4 -- VISUALIZATIONS

==> gglot2:
The ggplot2 package lets you make high quality, customizable plots of your data. As a refresher, ggplot2 is based on the grammar of graphics, which is a system for describing and building data visualizations. The essential idea behind the grammar of graphics is that you can build any plot from the same basic components, like building blocks. 

#create a plot
--> ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))

--> ggplot(data = penguins): In ggplot2, you begin a plot with the ggplot() function. The ggplot() function creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to. The first argument of the ggplot() function is the dataset to use in the plot. In this case, it’s “penguins.”

+: Then, you add a “+” symbol to add a new layer to your plot. You complete your plot by adding one or more layers to ggplot().

--> geom_point(): Next, you choose a geom by adding a geom function. The geom_point() function uses points to create scatterplots, the geom_bar function uses bars to create bar charts, and so on. In this case, choose the geom_point function to create a scatter plot of points. The ggplot2 package comes with many different geom functions. You’ll learn more about geoms later in this course.

--> (mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)): Each geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument. This defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties. The mapping argument is always paired with the aes() function. The x and y arguments of the aes() function specify which variables to map to the x-axis and the y-axis of the coordinate system. In this case, you want to map the variable “flipper_length_mm” to the x-axis, and the variable “body_mass_g” to the y-axis. 


==> Smoothing:
Smoothing enables the detection of a data trend even when you can't easily notice a trend from the plotted data points. ggplot2’s smoothing functionality is helpful because it adds a smoothing line as another layer to a plot; the smoothing line helps the data to make sense to a casual observer.

==> tilde (~) : Tilde operator is used to define the relationship between dependent variable and independent variables in a statistical model formula. The variable on the left-hand side of tilde operator is the dependent variable and the variable(s) on the right-hand side of tilde operator is/are called the independent variable(s). So, tilde operator helps to define that dependent variable depends on the independent variable(s) that are on the right-hand side of tilde operator. 

==>R Markdown:
R Markdown is a useful tool that allows you to save and execute code, and generate shareable reports for stakeholders.
